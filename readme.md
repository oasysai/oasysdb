# 👋 Meet OasysDB

OasysDB is an **embeddable**, **efficient**, and **easy to use** vector database. It is designed to be used as a library and embedded inside your AI application. It is written in Rust and uses [Sled](https://docs.rs/sled) as its persistence storage engine to save vector collections to the disk.

OasysDB implements **HNSW** (Hierachical Navigable Small World) as its indexing algorithm. It is a state-of-the-art algorithm that is used by many vector databases. It is fast, memory efficient, and it scales well to large datasets.

## Why OasysDB?

OasysDB is very flexible for use cases related with vector search such as using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method with an LLM to generate a context-aware output. OasysDB offers 2 major features that make it stand out from other vector databases or libraries:

- **Incremental vector operations**: OasysDB allows you to add, remove, or modify vectors from the collections without having to rebuild their indexes. This allows for a more flexible and efficient approach on storing your vector data.
- **Flexible persistence options**: You can choose to persist the vector collection to the disk or to keep it in memory. By default, whenever you use a collection, it will be loaded to the memory to ensure that the search performance is high.

# 🚀 Quickstart

This is a code snippet that you can use as a reference to get started with OasysDB. In short, use `Collection` to store your vector records or search similar vector and use `Database` to persist a vector collection to the disk.

```rust
use oasysdb::collection::*;
use oasysdb::database::Database;
use oasysdb::vector::*;

fn main() {
    // Vector dimension must be uniform.
    let dimension = 128;

    // Replace with your own data.
    let records = Record::many_random(dimension, 100);
    let query = Vector::random(dimension);

    // Open the database and create a collection.
    let mut db = Database::open("data/readme").unwrap();
    let collection =
        db.create_collection("vectors", None, Some(&records)).unwrap();

    // Search for the nearest neighbors.
    let result = collection.search(&query, 5).unwrap();
    println!("Nearest ID: {}", result[0].id);
}
```

# 🎯 Benchmarks

OasysDB uses a built-in benchmarking suite using Rust's [Criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion) crate which we use to measure the performance of the vector database.

Currently, the benchmarks are focused on the performance of the collection's vector search functionality. We are working on adding more benchmarks to measure the performance of other operations.

If you are curious and want to run the benchmarks, you can use the following command which will download the benchmarking dataset and run the benchmarks:

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Memory Usage

OasysDB implements HNSW algorithm which is known to be a memory hog compared to other flat indexing algorithms. We decided to use HNSW because it is fast and scales well to large datasets of vectors with large dimension.

Currently, we don't have any plan to change this indexing algorithm since we are currently focusing on the functionality and the interoperability of OasysDB with other libraries in different programming languages.

We might consider adding more indexing algorithms in the future to make OasysDB more flexible and to cater to different use cases.

If you are curious about the memory usage of OasysDB, you can use the following command to run the memory usage measurement:

```bash
cargo run --example measure-memory
```

## Quick Results

Even though the results may vary depending on the hardware and the dataset, we want to give you a quick idea of the performance of OasysDB. Here are some quick results from the benchmarks:

- **10,000 vectors with 128 dimensions**
  - Search time: 0.15 ms
  - Memory usage: 6 MB
- **1,000,000 vectors with 128 dimensions**
  - Search time: 1.5 ms
  - Memory usage: 600 MB

These results are from a machine with an Apple M2 CPU and 16 GB of RAM. The dataset used for the benchmarks is a random dataset generated by the `Record::many_random` function or SIFT datasets with additional random `usize` as its metadata.
